# Bert-explore-exploit
BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful natural language processing (NLP)  model. It has advanced the field of NLP by capturing contextual information bidirectionally, allowing it to comprehend the meaning of words in a sentence based on their surrounding context. In this repository, we try to explore and exploit BERT for vectorization for sentiment Analysis, in comparison with Word2Vec, to find information and data in documents using question-answer.
